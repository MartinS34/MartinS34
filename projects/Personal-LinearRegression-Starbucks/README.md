# Starbucks Seasonal Drinks Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Linear Regression and Matrix Operations** to analyze Starbucks' **seasonal drink sales trends**. The model predicts **optimal phase-out periods** for limited-time drinks based on **temperature, foot traffic, holidays, and time trends**.

## 🔬 Features
- **Linear Regression Model** to predict seasonal sales trends.
- **Uses SIMULATED Starbucks seasonal trends observed by a barista (Martin).**
- **Mathematical foundation:**
  - Matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion.
  - Computation of regression coefficients (β).
- **Visualization of sales trends over time.**

## 🛠️ How to Run the Analysis
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python LR_Math39.py
   ```
3. **View the results:**
   - The regression output will be displayed in the terminal.
   - A graph (`figure.png`) will show the predicted vs. actual sales trends.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Sales decline over time** as seasonal drinks lose popularity.
- **Holidays boost sales significantly** → Timing is critical for limited-time releases.
- **Warmer weather negatively impacts hot seasonal drinks.**
- **Daily foot traffic contributes to overall sales trends.**
