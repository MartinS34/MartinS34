# Analyzing Drug Effectiveness Using Weighted and Bayesian Ratings

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This academic project explores different methods to measure **drug effectiveness** using:
- **Weighted Ratings** (adjusted by useful counts)
- **Bayesian Scaling** (which favors drugs with more reviews)
- **Average Ratings** (traditional approach)

## ðŸ›  Tech/Tools Used
- **Shell Scripting (`cut`, `awk`)** â€“ Extracted and processed drug review data.
- **Python (Google Colab, Matplotlib)** â€“ Visualized effectiveness ratings.
- **Data Manipulation (TSV/CSV Processing)** â€“ Cleaned and structured data.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
1. Extracted **10 most common conditions** from the dataset using the `cut` command.
2. Used `awk` to **copy reviews** of these conditions into a separate file.
3. Wrote **two shell scripts**:
   - `wr.sh`: Calculates **weighted ratings** by multiplying each reviewâ€™s rating by its useful count.
   - `ar.sh`: Computes a **simple average rating** for each drug.
4. Implemented the **Bayesian Rating Formula** to adjust for the number of reviews.
5. Visualized **Weighted Ratings vs Average Ratings** for ADHD drugs in **Google Colab**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- **Weighted ratings** provide a **more accurate effectiveness measure** than simple averages.
- **Bayesian scaling** favors drugs with **higher review counts**, reducing bias.
- **Unexpected Result**: Bupropion, a **non-stimulant drug**, was more well received than stimulant ADHD drugs.
